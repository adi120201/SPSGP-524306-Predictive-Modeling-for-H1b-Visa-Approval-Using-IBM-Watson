1.1 OVERVIEW
Our objective in the Guided Project is to forecast the outcome of the numerous
professional overseas applicants who submit H-1B visa applications each year. In
this instance, we employed it to frame the issue as a classification problem and to
produce a forecast case status for the application. The applicant's characteristics
serve as the input for our system. In the United States, a non-immigrant visa called
an H-1B enables foreign people to work in professions that call for specialised
knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher in the relevant field.
